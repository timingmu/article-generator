"{\n    \"language style\": \"Clear, authoritative and accessible scientific writing. Uses precise technical terminology balanced with explanatory plain language. Maintains formal tone while incorporating engaging metaphors (e.g. 'sponge up' for wetlands, 'carbon bomb'). Favors active voice and concrete examples to explain complex concepts.\",\n    \n    \"narrative techniques\": \"Employs inverted pyramid structure starting with key points before details.

Transitions smoothly between concepts using cause-effect relationships. Incorporates both macro (global trends) and micro (specific examples) perspectives to build comprehensive understanding.\",\n    \n    \"innovation\": \"Effectively combines journalistic and scientific writing styles. Innovates by making technical content accessible without oversimplification. Uses creative analogies and real-world examples (e.g. comparing wetland water storage to swimming pools) to explain scientific concepts. Demonstrates skill in translating complex environmental and climate science for general audience while maintaining accuracy and depth.\"\n}"
